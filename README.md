# :wave: Introduction
This repository is a collection of notes on math I have found interesting and have decided to write down for both future reference and to solidify thought.

Please feel free to ask for clarification for anything that interests you.
Since they are notes first they may assume the reader is familiar with what I'm familiar with and aren't actively edited. 

# :notebook: PDFs
1. :game_die: Miscellaneous

The "main" pdf in the repository.
Lack any kind of inter-sections structure and is collection of notes in the rawest sense.
In the fullness of time sections may make there way from here to other pdfs.

2. :ocean: Fourier

An ordered collection of notes to do with the Fourier Transform.
Made with some amount of readability in mind.
In the sense that earlier parts of the document inform later parts.

3. :lock: Asymmetric Cryptography

Similar to Fourier but Asymmetric Cryptography instead of the Fourier Transform.

# :ballot_box_with_check: To-do
The ongoing construction of this repository will consist of two steps:

## :deciduous_tree: Incorporation of the Old
The editing, incorporation, or deletion or the following lose .tex files into this repository:
- ~~Airy~~ (In Fourier)
- ~~Chinese~~ (Not Math)
- ~~ComplexPhase~~ (Renamed to Cosine Transform)
- CoolChebyshev
- Dice
- DTFT
- Elementary Symmetric Polynomial
- Euler
- ~~Fourier~~ (Large and in a separate repository)
- ~~Geometry~~
- Goldenratio
- GreatSword
- ~~GroupTheoryIntegral~~
- Harmonic
- Hermite
- Lattice
- Logistic
- ~~MTG~~ (Not Math)
- NewtonGenerator
- NewtonSqrt
- ~~Non-decreasing~~ (Duplicate)
- Pentagonal
- Quintic
- ~~Rational_Tangent~~
- SpecialRelativity(Added the geometry component, the rest is kind of cringe)
- ~~Unit Fraction~~
- ~~Variance~~
- ~~WaveEq~~
- ~~Winquist~~

## :seedling: Creating the New
And add new notes directly too this repository, subject to change:

(This list is no longer being activily added too, now just a wish list of things to look into)
- ~~Convex Cords~~
- ~~Jensen's Inequality~~
- ~~Isosets~~
- ~~Pad√©~~
- Uniqueness of finite fields.
- ~~GF(2^8) in encryption and hashing~~ (Evolved into its own separate Repo)
- ~~Discontinuities of a monotonic function.~~
- ~~Interest~~
- ~~Lagragian Multiplier~~
- ~~Two cool p-adic number proofs~~
- ~~Quick Summary of Spaces~~
- ~~XOR hash~~
- Helmholtz decomposition (Incl. Fourier)
- Fouier Series from Nyquist style argument. (Maybe include the last two in fourier)
- Commuting Probability
- Laplace's Rule of Succession
