# Introduction
This repository is a collection of notes on math I have found interesting and have decided to write down for both future reference and to solidify thought.

Please feel free to ask for clarification for anything that interests you.
Since they are notes first they may assume the reader is familiar with what I'm familiar with and aren't actively edited. 

# Timeline
The initial construction of this repository will consist of two steps.

The editing, incorporation, or deletion or the following lose .tex files into this repository:
- ~~Airy~~ (In Fourier)
- ~~Chinese~~ (Not Math)
- ComplexPhase
- CoolChebyshev
- Dice
- DTFT
- Elementary Symmetric Polynomial
- Euler
- ~~Fourier~~ (Large and in a separate repository)
- Geometry
- Goldenratio
- GreatSword
- ~~GroupTheoryIntegral~~
- Harmonic
- Hermite
- Lattice
- Logistic
- ~~MTG~~ (Not Math)
- NewtonGenerator
- NewtonSqrt
- ~~Non-decreasing~~ (Duplicate)
- Pentagonal
- Quintic
- Rational_Tangent
- SpecialRelativity(Added the geometry component, the rest is kind of cringe)
- ~~Unit Fraction~~
- ~~Variance~~
- ~~WaveEq~~
- ~~Winquist~~

And add new notes directly too this repository, subject to change:
- ~~Isosets~~
- ~~Pad√©~~
- Uniqueness of finite fields.
- GF(2^8) in encryption and hashing
- ~~Discontinuities of a monotonic function.~~
- ~~Interest~~
- ~~Lagragian Multiplier~~
- ~~Two cool p-adic number proofs~~
- ~~Quick Summary of Spaces~~
- Helmholtz decomposition (Incl. Fourier)
- Fouier Series from Nyquist style argument. (Maybe include the last two in fourier)
