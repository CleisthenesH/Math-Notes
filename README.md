# Introduction
This repository is a collection of notes on math I have found interesting and have decided to write down for both future reference and to solidify thought.

# Timeline
The initial construction of this repository will consist of two steps.

The editing, incorporation, or deletion or the following lose .tex files into this repository:
- Airy
- Chinese
- ComplexPhase
- CoolChebyshev
- Dice
- DTFT
- Elementary Symmetric Polynomial
- Euler
- Fourier
- Geometry
- Goldenratio
- GreatSword
- GroupTheoryIntegral
- Harmonic
- Hermite
- Lattice
- Logistic
- MTG
- NewtonGenerator
- NewtonSqrt
- Non-decreasing
- Pentagonal
- Quintic
- Rational_Tangent
- SpecialRelativity
- Unit Fraction
- Variance
- WaveEq
- Winquist

And add new notes directly too this repository:
- GF(2^8) in encryption and hashing
- Discontinuities of a monotonic function.
