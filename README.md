Hi :wave: this repository is a backup of my math notes.
It is split into projects and  structured such that each project has its own tex files in the home directory and possibly an accompanying bib file or subdirectory.

| tex File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| miscellaneous | The main and most active project where miscellaneous sections are simply added as they are finished. |
| fourier | The first project on the Fourier transform. Largely sunsetted. |
| asymmetric_cryptography | Describing some asymmetric cryptosystems using modular arithmetic. |
| neural-network | Analysis of a toy model of a neural network using incidence algebra. |
| blossom_theory | Meant to be the application of blossoms to Bézier geometry, currently suffering from some scope creep. |
| common_preamble | A file containing a bunch utility declarations shared between the other tex files |

:warning: These notes haven't gone through any real peer-review. Only a fool would apply any result found here without conducting additional research :warning:
