	abstract={The paper studies two numerical characteristics of matrix incidence algebras over finite fields associated with generating sets of such algebras: the minimal cardinality of a generating set and the length of an algebra. Generating sets are understood in the usual sense, the identity of the algebra being considered a word of length 0 in generators, and also in the strict sense, where this assumption is not used. A criterion for a subset to generate an incidence algebra in the strict sense is obtained. For all matrix incidence algebras, the minimum cardinality of a generating set and a generating set in the strict sense are determined as functions of the field cardinality and the order of the matrices. Some new results on the lengths of such algebras are obtained. In particular, the length of the algebra of ``almost'' diagonal matrices is determined, and a new upper bound for the length of an arbitrary matrix incidence algebra is obtained.},
