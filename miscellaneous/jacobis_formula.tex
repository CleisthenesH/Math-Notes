\section{Jacobi's Formula}
Here's a little secret,
I've never actually proved Jacobi's formula before.
It looked like the type of linear algebra proof that would be grindy and boring.
But while reading about classical lie groups I realized it's actually quite easy to prove for invertible matrices,
and the proof is so close to generalizing to singular matrices.
\\

The adjugate matrix $\adj(A)$ is the transpose of the cofactor matrix and satisfies the following property:
\[A\adj(A) = \det(A)I\]
Jacobi's formula states that:
\[\frac{d}{d\,t}\det(A(t)) = \tr\left(\adj(A(t))\frac{d\,A(t)}{d\,t}\right)\]
Without loss of generality I will only prove the $t=0$,
to that end define:
\[B(t)=\adj(A(0))A(t)\]
Let $S_n$ be the $n$th permutation group and expand $\det(B(t))$:
\[\begin{aligned}
	\frac{d}{d\,t}\det(B(t)) &= \frac{d}{d\,t}\sum_{\sigma\in S_n}\sgn(\sigma)\sum_{k=1}^nB_{k,\sigma_k}(t)\\ 
	&= \sum_{\sigma\in S_n}\sgn(\sigma)\sum_{k=1}^nB'_{k,\sigma_k}(t)\prod_{\substack{l=1\\l\neq k}}^nB_{l,\sigma_l}(t)\\ 
\end{aligned}\]
By construction $B(0)=\det(A(0))I$ hence $B_{l,\sigma_l}(0)=\det(A(0))\delta_{l,\sigma_l}$ meaning:
\[\prod_{\substack{l=1\\l\neq k}}^nB_{l,\sigma_l}(0) = \begin{cases} \det(A(0))^{n-1} & l=\sigma_l \text{ for all $l\neq k$.}\\ 0 & \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}\]
The only such permutation is the identity permutation, meaning the sum reduces to:
\[\begin{aligned}
	\sum_{\sigma\in S_n}\sgn(\sigma)\sum_{k=1}^nB'_{k,\sigma_k}(0)\prod_{\substack{l=1\\l\neq k}}^nB_{l,\sigma_l}(0)&= \det(A(0))^{n-1}\sum_{k=1}^nB'_{k,k}(t) \\
	&=\det(A(0))^{n-1}\tr(B'(0))\\
	&=\det(\adj(A(0)))\tr(B'(0))\\
\end{aligned}\]
When we expand $B(t)$ back to $\adj(A(0))A(t)$ we get:
\[ \det(\adj(A(0)))\frac{d}{d\,t}\det(A(t))\bigg|_{t=0} = \det(\adj(A(0)))\tr(\adj(A(0))A'(0)) \]
When $A$ is invertible Jacobi's identity follows by cancelling $\det(\adj(A(0)))$.
