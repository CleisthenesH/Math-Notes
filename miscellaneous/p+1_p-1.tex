\section{Divisibility of $(p+1)(p-1)$}
It is well known that if $p$ is prime than either $p$ is a divisor of $6$ or has the remainder $1$ or $5$ when divided by $6$.
This can be verified by noting that a remainder of $0$,$2$, or $4$ would make $p$ divisible by $2$ and likewise for $0$ and $3$ for $3$.
\\

A cool corollary I saw today was that $p$ is a divisor of $6$ or $24$ is a divisor of $(p+1)(p-1)$.
This is also verified by cases:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|cccc|}
\hline
	$p\mod 12$&1&5&7&11\\
\hline
	$\gcd(p+1,12)$&2&6&4&12\\
	$\gcd(p-1,12)$&12&4&6&2\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The converse isn't true.
Since $24\cdot 3 = 72$,
but $(7-1)(7+1) = 48 < 72$ and $(11-1)(11+1) = 120 > 72$.
