\section{Rational Residue}
I saw a cool result.
That if $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials and $Q$ has a first order root at $a$ then the then:
\[\Res\left(\frac{P}{Q},a\right) = \frac{P(a)}{Q'(a)} \]
Which can save a lot of time over factorizing, 
which is what I would have done in the past.

This follows directly from:
\[Q'(a)=\frac{d}{dz}(z-a)q(z)\bigg|_a = q(a)\]
and
\[\oint_\gamma\frac{P(z)}{Q(z)}\,dz = \oint_\gamma \frac{P(z)}{(z-a)q(z)}\,dz = 2\pi i\frac{P(a)}{q(a)}\]
\\

I thought this might be generalizable since the general Leibniz rule on $Q(z)=(z-a)^2q(z)$ gives:
\[Q''(a)=2q(a),\quad Q'''(a)=6q'(a)\]
Hence for a second order root:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
	\oint_\gamma\frac{P(z)}{Q(z)}\,dz =& \oint_\gamma \frac{P(z)}{(z-a)^2q(z)}\,dz \\
	=& \pi i\frac{P'(a)q(a)-P(a)q'(a)}{q(a)^2}\\
	=& 2\pi i\frac{3P'(a)Q''(a)-P(a)Q'''(a)}{3Q'(a)^2}\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
Giving:
\[\Res\left(\frac{P}{Q},a\right)= \frac{3P'(a)Q''(a)-P(a)Q'''(a)}{3Q'(a)^2} \]

Which isn't as cool as the first order case,
and I don't feel like dealing with higher derivatives.

Still cool though.
