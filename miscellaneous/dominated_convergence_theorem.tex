\section{Dominated Convergence Theorem}
Consider the following sequences of integrals:
\[I_n = \int_0^1\log(t)^2(1-t)^n\,dt\]
It's related to the Harmonic numbers,
which is why it peaked my interest,
but it was presented in context where we wished to understand its asymptotics.
\\

The book answer of expressing it in terms of hypergeometric functions will be skipped,
because it's boring.

\subsection{Cauchy-Schwartz}
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\int_0^1\log(t)^2(1-t)^n\,dt \leq& \sqrt{\int_0^1\log^4(t)\,dt\int_0^1(1-t)^{2n}\,dt}\\
=&\sqrt{4! \frac{1}{2n+1}} \rightarrow 0
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
Which by the noticing the sign of $I_n$ and application of the sandwich theorem shows that $I_n \rightarrow 0$.

\subsection{Dominated Convergence Theorem}
As suggested by the section name, this is the result I really want to take notes about.
If a sequence of functions $f_n$ pointwise converge to $f$ and are dominated by some integrable function $g$ such that:
\[|f_n(t)| < g(t)\]
We have:
\[\int_S f_n\,d\mu \rightarrow \int_S f\,d\mu\]
Well rewrite the integral as:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{n}{\log(n)^2}\int_0^1\log(t)^2(1-t)^n\,dt 
=& \int_0^1\left(\frac{(\log(nt)-\log(n)}{\log(n)}\right)^2\left(1-\frac{nt}{n}\right)^n\,d\,nt \\
=&\int_0^n\left(\frac{\log(t)}{\log(n)}-1\right)^2\left(1-\frac{t}{n}\right)^n\,dt \\
=& \int_0^\infty\chi_{[0,n]}(t)\left(1-\frac{\log(t)}{\log(n)}\right)^2\left(1-\frac{t}{n}\right)^n\,dt\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

Set:
\[f_n(t) = \overbrace{\chi_{[0,n]}(t)\left(1-\frac{\log(t)}{\log(n)}\right)^2}^{g_n(x)}\overbrace{\left(1-\frac{t}{n}\right)^n}^{h_n(t)}\]
We have (pointwise):
\[f_n(t) \rightarrow \exp(-t)\]
We also have $h_n(t) \leq \exp(-t)$ and $g_n(t) \leq (1-\log(t))^2$,
meaning:
\[|f_n(t)| \leq (1-\log(t))^2\exp(-t)\]
Giving the desired result
(Assuming we can show the RHS converges, 
which I'm pretty sure we can since near $0$ we have $\int (1-\log(t))^2\,dt = t(\log(t)^2-4\log(t)+5)$ and far away we have $\exp(-t)$).
\[\frac{n}{\log(n)^2}\int_0^\infty\log(t)^2(1-t)^n\,dt \rightarrow \int_0^\infty\exp(-t)\,dt = 1\]
