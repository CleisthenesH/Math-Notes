\section{Harmonic Mean Probability}
Cool little result,
let there be a binary categorical random veritable with a probability $p$ of being $1$ and $1-p$ of being $0$.
Then we have the cool result:
\[\frac{\Pr(10)+\Pr(01)}{\Pr(11)+\Pr(00)} = \frac{2p(1-p)}{p^2+(1-p)^2} = \frac{2}{\frac{p}{1-p}+\frac{1-p}{p}}\]
The ratio of the chance of two dissimilar results to two similar results is the harmonic mean of $\frac{p}{1-p}$ and it's reciprocal.

Neat.
