\section{The Partial Derivative}

\subsection{Abuse of Notation}
Let $f$ be a function of $x$ and $y$
\[z = f(x,y)\]
It's common to write both:
\[\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\text{ and }\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\]
The function is better as as it formalizes the relationship and has a more rigorous 
\[\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\]
$t$ isn't an argument of $f$
abstract web of dependence 
My best recommendation is to acknowledge that the notation around differential geometry has been a mess for a while and to not be the hero try to fix it.

\[\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right)_y\]
\[z=f(x,g(x))\]
\[
	\left(\frac{\partial n}{\partial m'}\right)_{(x_m)_{m\in M_n}} =
	\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{n((x_m+h\delta_{m,m'})_{m\in M_n})-n((x_m)_{m\in M_n})}{h}
\]
