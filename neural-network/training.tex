Like a dynamic step size since we have this info?
Only when root finding.

Using error $l_2$ all the functions are twice differentiable so you can do the Lagrange form of the remainder thing.
Also only one root so how does that work with basins 

% I don't think this correct.
%\[x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{\Phi(x_n)}{|\nabla^2 \Phi(x_n)|}\nabla \Phi(x_n)\]
